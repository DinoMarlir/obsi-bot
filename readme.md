### Help me translating

Feel free to help me translating this bot. Just copy the `lang/english.json` file and change its name to the language you want to add. Now you can begin translating each entry.

## ⚠️ Please note: This is far from stable

I won't recommend using this bot until the first release marked as stable is out.
