# obsi-bot

obsi-bot is the next generation discord utility bot.
It is developed in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) using [kordex](https://github.com/Kord-Extensions/kord-extensions) and [kord](https://github.com/kordlib/kord)

### Help me translating

Feel free to help me translating this bot. Just copy the `lang/english.json` file and change its name to the language you want to add. For more specific information, look at the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/Obsilabor/obsi-bot/wiki/Using-translations)

## ⚠️ Please note: This is far from stable

I won't recommend using this bot until the first release marked as stable is out.
